# Final-Project
This is the code for my final project. It is for a webpage that is mostly just images of animals. 
I didn't get as far into this project as I wanted to because I had some challenges of figuting out
how to start coding in HTML. I am very proud of my webpage since I had no idea how to code in HTML or
CSS before this! I have attached a link to a tutorial I followed to make the majority of my blog because
it helped me a lot.
